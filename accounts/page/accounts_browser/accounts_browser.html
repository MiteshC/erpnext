			<li>To add child nodes, explore tree and click on the node under which you want to add more nodes.
			<li>Accounting Entries can be made against leaf nodes, called <b>Ledgers</b>. Entries against <b>Groups</b> are not allowed.
			<li>Please do NOT create Account (Ledgers) for Customers and Suppliers. They are created directly from the Customer / Supplier masters.
			<li><b>To create a Bank Account:</b> Go to the appropriate group (usually Application of Funds > Current Assets > Bank Accounts) and create a new Account Ledger (by clicking on Add Child) of type "Bank or Cash"
			<li><b>To create a Tax Account:</b> Go to the appropriate group (usually Source of Funds > Current Liabilities > Taxes and Duties) and create a new Account Ledger (by clicking on Add Child) of type "Tax" and do mention the Tax rate.
